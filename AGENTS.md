# Agent Guidelines

- Whenever you modify code or configuration, update `documentation/SETUP.md` to document the change.
- After completing your edits, run `npm run build` to generate the static site into the `docs/` directory.
- Project documentation lives in the `documentation/` folder:
  - `SETUP.md` – setup and maintenance instructions
  - `DESIGN_GUIDE.md` – style and design tokens
  - `PROMPTS.md` – prompts used to create the site
